## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
Since I've never really coded with Javascript and HTML a whole lot I used some youtube videos I had found online to complete the task. They really helped me understand how the coding language worked. Although I am still a bit confused on why certain things have to be coded that way.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge that I had encountered while creating this submission was basically jumping into coding with Javascript and HTML without knowing much from it. I did use these languages a little in the past but I never focused on these languages. The main language that I focused on was python and assembly languages. I overcame this challenge by looking up various youtube videos that would teach the basics of both of these languages. This did end up helping a lot as it helped me understand more but I feel I still have a lot to learn from these languages. Another challenge that I had encountered was not really understanding why certain things have to be coded a certain way. Because I mainly worked with python, coding in javascript felt very different for me. However, some of the construction of the code followed a similar format so some parts of the code were easier to understand than the rest. Another challenge that I encountered when creating this submission was the constant shifting of the deadline. The time deadline on the website kept shifting from 8:59 PM to 10:59 PM and back. This really confused me as I didn't know which deadline was the correct deadline. I think I can overcome this challenge as it is completely out of my hands. Another challenge I faced was creating the GIF with the programs. There seemed to be no download link for either of the programs and I was pretty confused on how to do it.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I have many questions about web development. I've never seen a program able to utilize HTML and Javascript and CSS before. This was a big surprise for me since I had thought that programs could only utilize other programs if they were the same language. Are there other languages that can do that too? Are all languages able to work together to create complex programs? How do these programs know which parts of which languages to take information from? I think these questions would definitely be answered once I look further into web development and understand how exactly these languages worked.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to work on the project. I would definitely try to work on the different optional challenges that were posted on the project website. Those challenges seem pretty difficult and I wanted to tackle them to see if I could do them with little prior knowledge of the languages. I would have also liked to take more time to learn more about HTML, Javascript, and CSS. However, I could for sure research them on my own time outside of this project too since I would like to understand as many languages as I can since each of them have their own unique capabilities.
